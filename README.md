A suite of tools for productivity analytics.

## Owner

[@mikkokotila](https://github.com/mikkokotila)

## Docs

### Get started

1) Download the package to your local machine
2) Start an environment inside `productivity-analytics` directory

### Collect data

To understand how the data is collected, check out [Basic Walkthrough](./examples/Basic-Walkthrough.ipynb). The data collection is currently per repo, so a separate dataset must be created for each repo following the examples given in the notebook.

### Analyze data

[Velocity Report](./examples/Velocity-Report.ipynb) answers the following questions for `cross-media-measurement` repo:

- How many days on average it takes to go from opening a PR to merging or closing it?
- How many PRs are each contributor opening?
- How many PR reviews or comments are each contributor making?
- How many PR change requests are each contributor making?
- How many back and forths with the PR author does it require to merge a PR?
