In the past, exchange tasks were launched as child coroutines of a specified `CoroutineScope`. At some point this logic was updated so that `ExchangeTaskExecutor.execute()` would create its own scope and launch jobs to execute tasks like so:

```kt
// ExchangeTaskExecutor.kt, shorted to emphasize the relevant parts
suspend fun execute(exchangeStep: ApiClient.ClaimedExchangeStep) = coroutineScope {
  launch {
    // executes exchangeStep in a try/catch block
  }
}
```

Since the outer `coroutineScope { ... }` block doesn't return until all of its child coroutines have completed, this effectively made it so that at most 1 exchange task could be executed at a time.

With this fix, we instead launch child coroutines from the site which calls `ExchangeTaskExecutor.execute()`, which once again allows us to run multiple exchange tasks concurrently.",2024-12-10 18:30:49+00:00,2024-12-16 18:46:09+00:00,2024-12-16 18:46:09+00:00,1,0,cross-media-measurement,1,300,213,9

    * Explicitly call `withDefaultCredentails()` when building `GcpKmsClient`. This used to happen by default, but seems to have been (inadvertently?) removed in a previous PR.
    * In `KingdomlessApiClient.kt`:
        * Make sure that `ExchangeWorkflowDependencyGraph` is built in step order. The dependency graph will throw if e.g. you try to mark a step as completed before its prerequisite steps.

Summary of changes:
* Introduces panel match internal versions of `ExchangeWorkflow` and `ExchangeStepAttempt` protobuf messages.
    * Exchange task logic now uses the internal `ExchangeWorkflow` exclusively.
    * Relevant tools have been updated to accept a `--exchange-workflow-format` flag to be compatible with both the v2alpha messages and the new internal ones. Supported formats are:
        * `V2ALPHA` - For exchanges that continue to use the Kingdom-based protocol with v2alpha messages.
        * `KINGDOMLESS` - For exchanges that have adopted the upcoming Kingdom-less protocol with panel match internal messages.
* Code related to claiming / validating / launching exchange tasks updated as follows:
    * `ApiClient.ClaimedExchangeStep` - Updated to remove references to v2alpha concepts. Notable changes:
        * The `attemptKey` for a step is now a panel match internal `ExchangeStepAttemptKey` with mostly the same info as before but no references to a ""resource name"".
        * Rather than creating a panel match internal `ExchangeStep` message, instead ported the necessary fields directly into `ClaimedExchangeStep`. These are: `exchangeDate`, `stepIndex`, and `workflow`.
        * **New field:** `workflowFingerprint`. When a claimed exchange step is being validated, the existing logic compares the serialized workflow returned by the Kingdom against the serialized workflow in private storage. I'm proposing that we now compare _fingerprints_ of the serialized workflows.

* There were some minor changes like updating the connection to the BFF, but the work is generally around making Get Report work.
* Notable work:
  * Updated the BFF Report model to match the latest BFF response. This won't affect List Reports since it doesn't go through the time intervals.
  * Added logic to consume the report and package the data to send to each chart.
  * Fixed a chart rendering bug - It wouldn't resize when the window resized. D3 doesn't detect that automatically.
  * Added a general multi-bar chart (the existing one has percentages on the Y-axes and is a single bar).
  * Added two chart wrappers (impressions, frequencies).
  * Added filter by demographic capability but still working on adding the UI for it.
* Minor work:
  * Updated most of the charts (some were already good) so they all take a ChartGroup instead of a custom object, making it easier to pass to D3.
  * Styled the charts a little better like max height.
  * Added a legend to the charts.
  * Changed Report State enum to a string because that's how it comes from the BFF despite being an enum.
  * Extended the number to string formatter to handle more cases and handle default better.
  * Created the sticky header for the warning/info banner.

Future PRs:
* Finish filter logic.
* Fix test data.
* Update some of the setX logic to handle the else case for non-cumulative data (where applicable).
* Update the chart displaying so it's more flexible to different data sets (eg. cumulative and non-cumulative).",2024-01-25 17:41:36+00:00,2024-01-29 17:30:38+00:00,,1,0,cross-media-measurement,2,664,237,47

* d3_wrapper: Fix chart resizing. Fix max height. Change ticks count so it makes more sense for both lots and few points. Added a legend. 
* total_reach, unique_reach_by_plat: Make name flexible for daily vs cumulative.
* index.css: Fixing font.
* index.html: Adding Google Analytics, updating title, and fixing js bundle path.

Justification: We have noticed that there are cases where multiple
IN_PROGRESS attempts exist for a single task. 
  - Whether those are active or not is unclear, but the result of this was if any fail or time out the task is set to READY_TO_RETRY while other attempts are currently IN_PROGRESS (which is not desirable). 
  - If there is somehow a newer attempt than the one being finished, we trust _that_ attempt will update the task state when it completes or times out and therefore the task is not, in fact, ready to retry.

Note that the granularity is ""a set of metrics"" that is associated with `MetricCalculationSpec`.

When a `MetricCalculationSpec` is reused in a different report, by identifying the pair of `MetricCalculationSpec` and the `ReportingSet` and the `TimeInterval`s from the report, we are able to identify the existing set of metrics created from the previous reports. This could be done during the internal report creation by the following:
1. Left join the table `Metrics` and `MetricCalculationSpecReportingMetrics` by `MeasurementConsumerId` and `MetricId`.
2. Find the set of metrics given `MeasurementConsumerId`, `ReportingSetId`, `MetricCalculationSpecId`, a set of `TimeIntervalStart` and `TimeIntervalEndExclusive`.
3. Repeat the process for all `ReportingMetricEntries`, i.e. pairs of `MetricCalculationSpecs` and `ReportingSets`.

At the step (2) above, the reason why we could get a set of metrics is because a `MetricCalculationSpec` could correspond to multiple metrics due to the fan-out of metric types, groupings, and time intervals.

Notes:
- Not sure the best naming for things. Especially interested in feedback for ""ListReportDetail"". Trying to specify it's the report model for listing reports - a simplified version compared to the full report.
- No pagination since we didn't work it into the UI mocks yet. Not a big deal since we won't have many reports to view anyways. This will need focus if a large amount of reports are being created.
- Open to suggestions on what to do about the key. Specifying a version in the value could be useful but there's a lot of unknowns (ie. no known requirements) right now.
- The existing Halo states make sense to show in the UI, but it doesn't have to map one to one.

* For impression/duration measurements, we have to set an impression/duration cap to guarantee differential privacy
* Currently, the measurement consumers(MC) select the cap, but it's challenging for MCs since the optimal cap should be chosen based on the frequency/duration distribution
* The Dynamic Clipping library allows the EDP to automatically optimize the cap for each campaign and to achieve higher accuracy than using a fixed cap, based on the frequency distribution of the events

### Need to Know
The Dynamic Clipping library is provided as a reference implementation for EDP to potentially improve impression/duration measurement accuracy. It is an optional EDP feature, and will require additional local market approval for deployment in production.

- Add a function to compute the margin of error of a 99.9% Confidence Interval (CI).
- Add a function to compute tolerances for relative frequency results.
- Check if reach results and frequency results are within 99.9% CI.

On top of the above functions, the two mills behave similarly in the initialization and confirmation phase. On the surface, it makes sense to also unify these behaviors inside the LiquidLegionsV2MillBase class. However, the effort to achieve this goal is high.

This pull request changes the data type of `Reach` and `Impression` variables from Int to Long in multiple functions and test cases within the code. 

## Why make this change
- The change to the data type of the ""totalReach"" variable from Int to Long allows for larger values to be used in the computation of variances.
- Updating the data classes to use Long data types instead of Int for certain variables ensures consistency and accuracy in the computation of variances.

## TL;DR
This pull request introduces a validation check for frequency histogram metrics to ensure they are only computed on union-only set expressions. It also updates the unit test name of when a reporting set is not accessible to the caller and adds a test case for the new validation check.

## What changed
1. In `MetricsService.kt`, a validation check was added to ensure that frequency histogram metrics are only computed on union-only set expressions. If this condition is not met, an `INVALID_ARGUMENT` error is thrown.
2. The name of the test case `createMetric throws INVALID_ARGUMENT when reporting set is not accessible to caller` was updated to `createMetric throws PERMISSION_DENIED when reporting set is not accessible to caller`.
3. A new test case `createMetric throws INVALID_ARGUMENT when Frequency Histogram metric is computed on non-union-only set expression` was added in `MetricsServiceTest.kt`.
4. Comments were added in `metric.proto` to provide more context about the conditions under which univariate statistics are computed.

This change ensures that frequency histogram metrics are computed correctly and provides more informative error messages to the user. It also improves the clarity of the code by adding explanatory comments.",2023-09-22 05:06:21+00:00,2023-09-26 19:34:34+00:00,2023-09-26 19:34:34+00:00,2,0,cross-media-measurement,1,60,10,3

Currently keep using the old DP_ADVANCED composition with MPC Geometric(Laplace) noise and direct Laplace noise for backward compatibility. Once MPC DP noise is switched to Discrete Gaussian noise in Kingdom, and direct DP noise is switched to Gaussian in EDP simulator, change compositionMechasnim to ACDP and start using ACDP composition in PBM. 

ACDP composition can only be used with MPC discrete Gaussian or direct Gaussian noise. Otherwise, the requisition will be refused. The old DP_ADVANCED PBM ledger and composition methods, old PrivacyBucketCharges BackingStore table should be deprecated/deleted after migration to ACDP is completed/stabilized.

Major changes in this PR:
* Create a new CompositionMechasnim flag(DP_ADVANCED, ACDP) in EdpSimulatorFlags
* EDP simulator supports charging privacy budget in ACDP composition
* Charge privacy budget for direct measurements
* Add EDP simulator unit tests for the new ACDP methods

a) Non-aggregators add noise registers to the crv and shuffle the modified crv. They encrypt their excessive noise using the composite El Gamal public key. They send the crv and the excessive noise ciphertext to the aggregator.
b) Aggregator: Waits for the crv and the excessive noise ciphertexts from non-aggregators. It adds noise to the crv, shuffles it, and encrypts its excessive noise with the composite El Gamal key. It then combines the excessive noise ciphertexts by adding them together. It sends the modified crv and the excessive noise ciphertext to the next worker.

Notes:
- Using `pnpm` to better manage a monorepo of JS apps. The root config will have common packages. Each app can override/add their own as they need as well as additional configuration.
- Using `gts` as a linting/prettify tool. It wraps `eslint` and `prettifier`.
- Using `webpack` with `babel` to bundle and transpile TSX/TS. `react-scripts` was limited in its configuration to setup in a monorepo. Specifically it assumes the index is at `public/index.html` and not in a subdirectory. It also outputs files to a hardcoded root, which can cause problems if we have multiple apps. Also it's doing a lot of hand waving that may have issues like browser compatibility.

Future PRs:
- Add linter to the build (the tool, gts, and configs are currently in place but not being run anywhere)
- Finish moving the tests (moved them out of the src directory, but working on getting jest configured)

To multithread the execution of LLV2. Currently all for-loops are single-threaded but iterations are actually independent. They can be refactored into a multi-threading pattern.
Most operations rely on [ProtocolCryptor](https://sourcegraph.com/github.com/world-federation-of-advertisers/cross-media-measurement/-/blob/src/main/cc/wfa/measurement/common/crypto/protocol_cryptor.cc). Unfortunately, the class ProtocolCryptor is not thread-safe. Thus, multiple identical ProtocolCryptors must be created and each thread should have a dedicated ProtocolCryptor. 
Current iterations append results directly to the output variable. This is not a good pattern for multiple threading if the order matters because the execution order of iterations is not deterministic.

## Design 
The general idea is to have a helper class assigning tasks to multiple threads and collect output after execution.
### Parameters
The helper has three primary parameters: data, # iterations, and a lambda expression.
The lambda expression reuses current code as the task to run. Given data and # iterations, the helper execute the lambda expression with index from 0 to (# iterations -1). Thus, the helper can split tasks even if the input is in batch as a variable `data`.
Capture list of the lambda expression has all the variables to execute iterations. No major change required from current for-loop block. 
### Results
Lambda expression is responsible for handling results from iterations and making sure it is thread-safe.
### Cryptors
The ProtocolCryptor is not thread-safe. Each thread should have its own ProtocolCryptor to execute lambda expressions.
The helper can be reused multiple times with different types of input and output. ProtocolCryptor only needs to be initialized once. For example SetupPhase, it has multiple for-loops to add various types of noise. Only one helper need to create and reuse.
Some procedure does not require ProtocolCryptor thus can skip `setupCryptors`.

## Class Interface
See the header file.

## Usage
See the unit test.

* In the current design, the metric state is updated using a on-demand strategy -- only updated when the public `get` or `list` is called. This causes the internal metric state is not consistent with what the states of the associated measurements indicate. For example, a metric might have all measurements with SUCCEEDED states, but itself is PENDING. 



Design change:

* The metric state is essentially a derivative from the states of the associated measurements. Therefore, we could instead determine the metric state in the public server call and remove the state column in the internal metrics DB.

* Similarly, the metric result can be calculated easily on the public side, so we don't need to store metric result in the database.",2023-04-21 21:01:40+00:00,2023-04-25 17:21:33+00:00,2023-04-25 17:21:33+00:00,5,0,cross-media-measurement,2,229,578,6

1. For duchy's api `enqueue()`, do we need extra check to see if the token's lock owner is the same as current token?
No. The computationService checks whether the token is the latest version which guarantees that the lockowner in the request must be the same as the current lockowner. 
Currently this api is only used by mills to request retries for failed computations.

2. Do we need mill's retry backoff mechanism given the FIFO behavior for computations.
Yes. It is good-to-have feature. When we set backoff base to 0, it means mills should immediately retry failed computations (because they are the oldest, of course). On the other side, we might want the mills to calm down and work on other computations. Thus this mechanism add a cooldown time for retriable computations.

One example is when an invalid value of delta is given, but many others can be found by grepping for 'error' in the code.  When an exception is generated, the Herald enters an infinite loop of continuously retrying the request that generated the exception.  This pull request eliminates this infinite loop.

Unfortunately, this is only part of work that has to be done to correct the way in which exceptions are handled.  It appears that currently, the herald has no way of propagating exceptions back to the kingdom.  Consequently, a failed computation will permanently appear to be in progress and will never progress to the COMPLETED or FAILED state, and the measurement consumer will never learn why their computation failed.  This will take more significant rework, which is deferred to a future PR.

However, gcp-kingdom-data-server often takes significantly longer to initialize than resource-setup-job.  This can cause the resource-setup-job to timeout and fail, which then breaks the deployment.

 When a specific resource is not found, use `FAILED_PRECONDITION`, `INVALID_ARGUMENT` or `NOT_FOUND`?

 As `INVALID_ARGUMENT` is more about the format of arguments, avoid to use it in our cases.

 When the major entity is not found, use `NOT_FOUND`. For example, if `getMeasurement` or `updateMeasurement` fail to find the `Measurement`, we call it `NOT_FOUND`.

 Other than the major entity, use `FAILED_PRECONDITION`. For example, for `getMeasurement` or `updateMeasurement`, if `Account`/`MeasurementConsumer`/`Certificate` not found, call it `FAILED_PRECONDITION`.

 When a specific resource is not found, use `FAILED_PRECONDITION`, `INVALID_ARGUMENT` or `NOT_FOUND`?

 As `INVALID_ARGUMENT` is more about the format of arguments, avoid to use it in our cases.

 When the major entity is not found, use `NOT_FOUND`. For example, if `getMeasurement` or `updateMeasurement` fail to find the `Measurement`, we call it `NOT_FOUND`.

 Other than the major entity, use `FAILED_PRECONDITION`. For example, for `getMeasurement` or `updateMeasurement`, if `Account`/`MeasurementConsumer`/`Certificate` not found, call it `FAILED_PRECONDITION`.

1. KingdomInternalException is now a sealed class. Each error code has 1 or more derivative class to create the instance of internal exception with required contextual information.
For example, 
`MEASUREMENT_CONSUMER_NOT_FOUND` has one class `MeasurementConsumerNotFound` requiring `externalMeasurementConsumerId` as context info
`MEASUREMENT_NOT_FOUND` has two classes: `MeasurementNotFoundByComputation` requires `externalComputationId`; `MeasurementNotFoundByMeasurementConsumer` requires `externalMeasurementConsumerId` and `externalMeasurementId`.
`CERITIFICATE_NOT_FOUND` is complicated. It has `DataProviderCertificateNotFoundByExternal`, `DataProviderCertificateNotFoundByInternal`, `MeasurementConsumerCertificateNotFoundByExternal`, `MeasurementConsumerCertificateNotFoundByInternal` and `DuchyCertificateNotFound`.  (Please share your thought if any other idea)


2. Applied the new mechanism to exception throwers.
In .../spanner/writers/ConfirmComputationParticipant.kt, one of the errors should be `MeasurementStateIllegal` in stead of `ComputationParticipantStateIllegal`.

In addition:
* Makes the BackingStore and TransactionContext implement Closeable (to make sure transactions are either commited or rolledback and connections are closed)
* Transactions can't be nested (given the limitation of one SQL transaction per JDBC connection) - ideally each thread should use it's own  `PostgresBackingStore` instance, so the test simulates this
* Adds `PostgresBackingStoreTest`, based on the changes listed above. It uses `EmbeddedPostgres` to run the tests.

The PR also
1. uploaded a synthetic-labelled-events.csv for completing correctnessTest
on GKE
2. switched the order of EDP and MC creation in the resourceSetupJob to
make sure we call the kingdom public API first. Otherwise, the job may
call the internal kingdom API successfully and fail later when calling
the public API. If this happens, the retry would fail constantly since
the EDPs are already created.
3. Deleted the labels in the NetworkPolicy, since NetworkPolicy doesn't
supoort labels.

shared outputs field. Changes field type from bytes (blob) to string
with the expectation that the storage step will pass signed cloud
storage urls containing the exchange data blob rather than the actual blob
itself. These blobs would likely be quite large and not work as part of
an API reponse directly. As this proto is not yet used it does not seem
necessary to reserve the existing shared_ouputs and use a new field
name despite the change in field type.

previously, the mill would fetch all local requisitions from the

Now, the mill just verify requistions status based on the database information,
